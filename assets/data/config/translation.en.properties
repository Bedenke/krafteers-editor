I'm part of the search team that picked up an S.O.S signal in the Atlantic Ocean.\nWhile searching, our small plane crashed after a storm hit us out of nowhere.\n\nI woke up on a beach. I'm thirsty, and I'm hurt, but I'm alive.\nI'm writing this journal in case I don't survive. Right now, I need to find water... and figure out where I am.

logbook.MainIsland.TheWreckage.Title = The Wreckage
logbook.MainIsland.TheWreckage.Journal = I found some useful items in the airplane wreckage, especially a medical kit. I have a feeling I'll need them later if I want to survive long enough.

logbook.MainIsland.ToolsOfStone.Title = Tools of Stone
logbook.MainIsland.ToolsOfStone.Journal = I crafted some basic tools: an axe and a spear. They're enough to cut wood, hunt, and defend myself from the animals here. But it doesn't feel like enough. There's something strange about this island, something I can't explain yet.

logbook.MainIsland.Hunter.Title = Hunter
logbook.MainIsland.Hunter.Journal = I've set up a small camp with a fire. After hunting an animal, I cooked my first meal. For now, hunger won't kill me.\n\nBut surviving here is only the beginning.

logbook.MainIsland.TheMonolith.Journal = My curiosity nearly killed me today. I somehow activated the strange monolith and we were attacked by some kind of monsters.

logbook.MainIsland.FourTowers.Title = Towers
logbook.MainIsland.FourTowers.Journal = I'm beginning to understand the Shaman. He explained that the monsters come from the portals - another dimension, or "from down under", as he called it. They carry strange power artifacts, and I have to use it to build defenses.

logbook.MainIsland.Map.Title = A Map
logbook.MainIsland.Map.Journal = It's not just one island - I'm in an archipelago. There are other islands nearby, but it's too dangerous to explore without protection.

logbook.MainIsland.Sewing.Title = Sewing
logbook.MainIsland.Sewing.Journal = It wasn't easy, but I finally figured out how to make clothes and shoes out of leather. They're rough, but they'll keep me warm and protected.

logbook.MainIsland.FirstExpedition.Title = First Expedition
logbook.MainIsland.FirstExpedition.Journal = I've started calling the natives "Krafteers". With their help, I built a shelter to sleep through the night. The nights here are terrifying - creatures appear out of nowhere, and their presence is enough to chill you to the bone.

logbook.MainIsland.Mining.Title = The Mines
logbook.MainIsland.Mining.Journal = I discovered rocks and iron ore near the camp. With these resources, I can craft better tools and weapons. It will also help reinforce the fortress walls - something we'll definitely need.

logbook.MainIsland.Blacksmith.Title = Blacksmith
logbook.MainIsland.Blacksmith.Journal = I've set up everything I need to call myself a blacksmith. With the right tools, I can now craft stronger iron weapons and equipment. I'll need them as new monsters are appearing, and they're getting harder to defeat.

logbook.MainIsland.PoisonTowers.Title = Poison Towers
logbook.MainIsland.PoisonTowers.Journal = Those damned poisonous spiders! But at least their venom has a use. I've managed to coat my towers with their poison, making them deadlier for the monsters.\n\nThey'll have a harder time getting through now.

logbook.MainIsland.FantasticWeapons.Title = Fantastic Weapons
logbook.MainIsland.FantasticWeapons.Journal = The Shaman's powers are real. He applied an artifact to my bow, making it far powerful. I'll need this to defend against the growing threats. It makes me wonder if there are other types of artifacts out there, I'll keep opening the portals and find out.

logbook.MainIsland.ThePortals.Title = The Portals
logbook.MainIsland.ThePortals.Journal = I've activated a portal. The Shaman says this will draw the "Gatekeeper", the one who holds the key to their survival, and hopefully my way back home.

logbook.MainIsland.FortressOfStone.Journal = I've built a stone fortress, and for now, it's keeping the monsters at bay. It's solid, but I know it won't last forever. If I can reinforce the walls with iron, we'll stand a much better chance.

logbook.MainIsland.Farming.Title = Farming
logbook.MainIsland.Farming.Journal = Things are starting to look up. I've managed to plant some corn, which should help with food supplies. I've also discovered that if I can tame the boars, their manure could be used as fertilizer to boost my corn fields. I can cook delicious cornbread.

logbook.MainIsland.TheSunsetting.Title = The Sunsetting
logbook.MainIsland.TheSunsetting.Journal = I ventured west, through strange and dangerous lands, and finally, I found another survivor: a soldier. He told me he was part of a military exercise when a storm knocked his aircraft carrier off course. Just like me, he's stranded here.\n\nI'm taking him back to the fortress. He'll be safe there and help us fight.

logbook.MainIsland.HellfireManace.Title = Hellfire Menace
logbook.MainIsland.HellfireManace.Journal = A fire-breathing monster... I should've known something like this would appear eventually. But now, it's my turn to turn the tables. I'll find a way to harness hellfire and use it against them.

logbook.MainIsland.FightFireWithFire.Title = Fight Fire With Fire
logbook.MainIsland.FightFireWithFire.Journal = With the Shaman's guidance, we've built new towers and weapons infused with hellfire magic. I'm eager to see how these will perform in battle. The monsters won't know what hit them.

logbook.MainIsland.TheFirePortal.Title = The Fire Portal
logbook.MainIsland.TheFirePortal.Journal = I've activated another portal, and something feels off. I'm starting to wonder if my plane crash wasn't just bad luck. Could all this power, these portals, be behind the crashes and shipwrecks?\n\nThe more I uncover, the more it all seems connected.

logbook.MainIsland.SouthernDesert.Title = Southern Desert
logbook.MainIsland.SouthernDesert.Journal = The expedition to the south was a success. I found a doctor, stranded like the rest of us. He said he was responding to a rescue call when his helicopter was caught in a dark fog.\n\nHe's agreed to come with me to the fortress and help care for the wounded. In this endless battle, we'll need his skills.

logbook.MainIsland.TheIronFortress.Title = The Iron Fortress
logbook.MainIsland.TheIronFortress.Journal = After countless hours of mining, I've finally reinforced the fortress with iron walls. It feels stronger now, more secure. But even with this added protection, I'm not sure it will be enough to stop the growing threats coming through the portals.

logbook.MainIsland.TheRisingSun.Title = The Rising Sun
logbook.MainIsland.TheRisingSun.Journal = We made it to the east, it was quite the journey! I found a survivor, a skilled archer. She managed to survive after the ship she was on sank. She couldn't explain what happened, but she recalled hearing screams about a dark iceberg that caught the captain by surprise.\n\nI rescued her, and now she's joining us. Her arrows will be a great help in the battles ahead.

logbook.MainIsland.NorthernBlizzard.Title = Northern Blizzard
logbook.MainIsland.NorthernBlizzard.Journal = The cold in the north is brutal. Among the wolves and undead, I found an engineer, barely surviving since his shipwreck. He doesn't remember much, just waking up on the beach after hearing terrified shouts and feeling the ship tear in half.\n\nHe'll be invaluable in helping to keep our fortress standing strong.

logbook.MainIsland.LoneWolves.Title = Lone Wolves
logbook.MainIsland.LoneWolves.Journal = I've discovered that I can tame the wolves roaming the island. They're incredible creatures, and with them by my side, I feel much safer.\n\nThese wolves could make all the difference in the battles ahead.

logbook.MainIsland.Icebreaker.Title = Icebreaker
logbook.MainIsland.Icebreaker.Journal = Getting frozen by that ice monster was a nightmare. But now I'm wondering... can I turn this power against them? If I can harness their ice, it might be our next advantage.

logbook.MainIsland.FreezeThem.Title = Freeze Them
logbook.MainIsland.FreezeThem.Journal = The fortress grows stronger by the day. We've added ice defenses, and now we can freeze the monsters in their tracks, holding them still while we strike with everything we've got.

logbook.MainIsland.TheFrozenPortal.Title = The Frozen Portal
logbook.MainIsland.TheFrozenPortal.Journal = Nearly all the portals are active now, just one remains. Each step forward is harder than the last, but we're so close to the Gatekeeper. I can't shake the feeling that I wasn't just stranded here by accident.\n\nWas it the island itself? The Monolith? Or could it have been the Shaman all along?\n\nI'm not sure who - or what - brought me to this cursed place.

logbook.MainIsland.TheGatekeeperPortal.Title = The Gatekeeper Portal
logbook.MainIsland.TheGatekeeperPortal.Journal = All the portals are activated, just as the Shaman instructed. Now, to save them, and myself, we must face the ultimate challenge from every side. The Gatekeeper is the key to ending all of this.

logbook.MainIsland.TheMorningStar.Title = The Morning Star
logbook.MainIsland.TheMorningStar.Journal = The Shaman has finally crafted the ultimate weapon: the Morning Star. With it, we can destroy the Monolith and put an end to this madness. For the first time, I feel a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I'll find my way back home.

logbook.MainIsland.TheHope.Title = The Hope
logbook.MainIsland.TheHope.Journal = Oh no! Oh no... What have I done?! Did the Shaman deceive me? I thought I was saving them, saving the island! I thought I was doing the right thing. But now, I fear I've only unleashed destruction, not just here, but upon our world.\n\nThere's no turning back now. All I can do is fight... until the very end.

logbook.MainIsland.TheEnd.Title = The End
logbook.MainIsland.TheEnd.Journal = Sometimes it takes losing everything to realize what we had. I was deceived by the Krafteers, by the Shaman. My desire to help, and my greed for power, were all they needed to open the gates of hell and start the apocalypse.\n\nSo this is how the world ends, huh? Us foolish little humans and our infinite desire for more.
